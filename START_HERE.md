# 👋 START HERE - Your Auth App is Ready!

## 🎉 What You Have

A **complete authentication system** with:
- ✅ Beautiful sign in/sign up pages (Shopify style)
- ✅ Supabase backend integration
- ✅ Protected dashboard
- ✅ Full authentication flow

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase (5 minutes)

1. Go to **[supabase.com](https://supabase.com)** and create a free account
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Fill in project details and wait for it to initialize
4. Go to **Settings** (⚙️ icon) → **API**
5. Copy your:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Update Your .env File

The `.env` file has been created in your project root. Open it and replace the placeholder values:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-actual-key...
```

### Step 3: Run Your App

In your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5174`)

## ✨ Test It Out

1. Click **"Get started →"** to go to sign up
2. Enter an email and password
3. You'll be signed up and redirected to the dashboard!
4. Try signing out and signing back in

## 📚 Documentation

- **SUPABASE_SETUP.md** - Detailed Supabase configuration
- **README.md** - Complete project documentation  
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - What was built and how it works

## ⚙️ Optional: Disable Email Confirmation (for testing)

By default, Supabase requires email confirmation. To test faster:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
3. Toggle **OFF** "Confirm email"
4. Click **Save**

Now you can sign up without waiting for email!
