# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get your authentication app running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Create Your `.env` File

**IMPORTANT**: You need to create a `.env` file manually in the root directory.

1. In the root directory of this project (same level as `package.json`), create a new file called `.env`

2. Copy and paste this content into your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

3. **Keep this file for now** - We'll update it in the next step

## Step 2: Create a Supabase Project (2 minutes)

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and click "Start your project"

2. Sign up or log in (you can use GitHub)

3. Click "New Project" and fill in:
   - **Name**: `zarly` (or any name you want)
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save it somewhere!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to you
   
4. Click "Create new project" and wait 1-2 minutes

## Step 3: Get Your API Keys

1. In your Supabase dashboard, look on the left sidebar and click the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** icon

2. Click **API** in the settings menu

3. You'll see:
   - **Project URL**: Something like `https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co`
   - **Project API keys ‚Üí anon public**: A long key starting with `eyJ...`

4. Copy these two values

## Step 4: Update Your `.env` File

1. Open your `.env` file again

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

3. Save the file

## Step 5: Run Your App! üéâ

In your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:5174` (or another port if shown in the terminal)

## Step 6: Test It Out

1. Open the URL in your browser
2. Click "Get started ‚Üí" to go to the sign up page
3. Enter an email and password
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard!

## üéä Success!

Your authentication is now fully working with Supabase!

### What You Can Do Now:

- ‚úÖ Sign up new users
- ‚úÖ Sign in existing users
- ‚úÖ Access protected dashboard
- ‚úÖ Sign out
- ‚úÖ All user data is stored in Supabase

### Optional: Enable Email Confirmation

By default, Supabase might require email confirmation. To test without email confirmation:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Email**
3. Toggle OFF "Confirm email"
4. Click Save

Now you can sign up without waiting for email confirmation!

## üÜò Having Issues?

### Can't find the .env file?
- Make sure you're creating it in the ROOT directory (same folder as package.json)
- The file name is exactly `.env` (with the dot at the beginning)
- On Windows, create it as `.env.` and it will automatically become `.env`

### "Missing Supabase environment variables" error?
- Check that your `.env` file has both variables
- Make sure variable names start with `VITE_` (all caps)
- Restart your dev server after creating/editing `.env` (Stop with Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev` again)

### Can't sign up or sign in?
- Double-check your Supabase URL and key in `.env`
- Make sure you copied the `anon public` key, not the `service_role` key
- Check there are no extra spaces or quotes around your values
